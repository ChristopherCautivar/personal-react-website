# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Personal-React-Website

A basic react website created by using this video as a guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQAHSlTtcmY. I already have some experience from my classes in a similar framework (Angular), so I'm hoping to use this simple project as a base to eventually create a website where I can host or demo most of my work on a platform as a service, such as Heroku.

## Next Steps
Now that I've completed the basic tutorial, much of my angular and webdev knowledge is coming back to me. My next steps will be:
* ~~Deploy to Heroku~~
* Integrate a React router
* Create a Habit tracker
* ~~Create a Release that contains all original code~~
    * ~~Remove unnecessary boilerplate code that has been commented out~~
* Containerize this app
* Display Github projects as "products"
    * Implement a cart which lets users "buy" the projects
        * Use a fictional currency
    * This should give me practice with API's within React, among other key concepts
    * Either host projects or display their README's which should have demo gifs displayed
